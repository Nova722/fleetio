    #####freshness checks are great for data you know should be updated
    #####normally this would be configured depending on the expected freshness of this data and there

    loaded_at_field: created_at
    freshness:
      warn_after: { count: 3000, period: day }
      error_after: { count: 5000, period: day }

    tables:
      - name: raw_accounts
        freshness: null ###no created_at in this table therefore no freshness check
